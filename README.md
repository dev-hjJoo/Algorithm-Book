# Algorithm Book
A summary of algorithm and problem-solving techniques using Python.
In this repository, the emphasis has been on code implementation, and for a more detailed explanation of the concepts, please refer to the Notion page ([link](https://hyoz.notion.site/Algorithm-Dictionary-9c25e49e73c9440ca5cfe07d8e6b13f1?pvs=4)).

## Table of Contents
1. Greedy Algorithm

## Project Overview
* The start date of this project is Thursday, October 19, 2023.
* This project has two main goals:
    1. Achieving the highest level on Baekjoon (Ruby) within 6 months. (I'm currently Silver 5 🥹)
    2. Daily study of algorithms and documenting the content in this repository.
* Content is organized in Jupyter notebook format, combining both code and explanations.
* We use Python (version 3.9.16) as the primary programming language, and any necessary libraries will be introduced on the respective pages.
* The internal code is not a direct copy of the book's code, but is code I wrote myself. I used the code in the book only to verify that my code was correct. (So, some of the code or explanation may be wrong. If you check it, please leave an issue!😉)

## How to Use
Feel free to observe, comprehend, and contribute to this repository. However, if you wish to add content to this repository, please review the following rules.
### Commit message
* Title (head)
    * example
        ```bash
        Prefix: Brief summary (#IssueNumber)
        ```
    * The prefix can be one of the following: test, docs, code.
    * The brief summary should be written in imperative mood without a period at the end.
    * The issue number is optional but can be included if the commit relates to a specific issue.
* Content
    * If the title contains all the necessary information, there is no need to write content.
    * The content of the commit message should focus on **‘what’ and ‘why’** rather than ‘how’.
